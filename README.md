### Hello :D
<br>
My name's Chris and I'm a French student who really likes math and programming (mostly math but still),
so I'm putting some of the things I've done here on GitHub in hopes that it will be helpful to someone at some point.
<br>
<br>
I've been using surface-level batch for a couple years, and have been learning Java and Python for a while, and I guess I could also mention that I know a bit of HTML and CSS, and you could throw JavaScript into the mix because I'm a proud user of <href a="https://www.geogebra.org/u/chris_mzz">GeoGebra</href>.
I can't really describe how good or bad I am with them because I don't really have a good grasp on what's considered good or bad around here, 
so I'll let you look at my code and judge for yourself.
<br>
Again, still learning, so don't be too harsh ^^'
<br>
<br>
As previously mentionned, I like math a lot, so as of 2022 I'm still a student but that's probably the field I'm the most knowledgeable in, and as you can probably imagine from a math student who likes computers, I use LaTeX on a daily basis.
<br>
<br>
Apart from math, I guess I should probably mention I have a huge history with music production (__Chris Mzz.__ on Spotify and YouTube if that's something you're into ðŸ‘€) 
and I also have plans to get a career in that field.
<br>
<br>
If you want to e-mail me, my student e-mail is christopher.mazzerbo@etu.univ-amu.fr, so feel free if you need help with any project, I'd be happy to help ^^
