### Hello :D
<br>
My name's Chris and I'm a French student who really likes math and programming (mostly math but still),
so I'm putting some of the things I've done here on GitHub in hopes that it will be helpful to someone at some point.
<br>
<br>
I've been using surface-level batch for a solid 10 years now, and have been studying Python for quite a while now. I guess I could also mention that I know a bit of HTML, PHP and CSS, and you could throw JavaScript into the mix because I'm a proud user of <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/u/chris_mzz">GeoGebra</a>, which got me into learning basics of JS (I definitely find myself needing it from time to time).
I can't really describe how good or bad I am with them because I don't really have a good grasp on what's considered good or bad around here, 
so I'll let you look at my code and judge for yourself.
<br>
Again, still learning, so for the more experienced people here, don't be too harsh ^^'
<br>
<br>
As previously mentionned, I like math a lot, so as of 2023 I'm still a student but that's probably the field I'm the most knowledgeable in, and as you can probably imagine from a math student who likes computers, I use LaTeX on a daily basis. To be more specific, I'm currently a student at the Computational and Mathematical Biology master in Aix-Marseille UniversitÃ©.
<br>
<br>
Apart from math, I guess I should probably mention I have a huge history with music production (<strong>Chris Mzz.</strong> on Spotify and YouTube if that's something you're into ðŸ‘€) 
and I also have plans to get a career in Numerical Analysis, either to work in music plugin production or biotech.
<br>
<br>
If you want to e-mail me, my student e-mail is <i>christopher.mazzerbo@etu.univ-amu.fr</i>, so feel free if you need help with any project, I'd be happy to help ^^
<br>
<br>
A couple mentions that don't deserve being in a proper sentence because I don't want to embarrass myself (I'll try including examples of some projects when I upload them) : Matlab (because AMU gave us a license lol), Lua (for Noita modding), Java (school projects), C# (Hollow Knight modding, and modding in general), Scheme (GIMP scripting is a <a href="https://github.com/ChrisMzz/julia/blob/main/gimp/julia-zoom.scm">NIGHTMARE</a>)
